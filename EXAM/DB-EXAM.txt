Data vs. Information and Knowledge
Data are raw facts
Information is the result of processing raw data to reveal meaning
Information requires context to reveal meaning
Raw data must be formatted for storage, processing, and presentation
Data are the foundation of information, which in turn can lead to new knowledge

Data: the building blocks of information (raw facts)	
e.g. a student’s name, address etc.

Information: produced by processing data
e.g. the total number of students enrolled in each course

Knowledge is the discovery of new patterns and relationships in data that allow actions to be taken
e.g. Discovering the characteristics of students who fail and taking steps to reduce this problem

Introducing the Database and the DBMS
Database: shared, integrated computer structure that stores a collection of data
End-user data: raw facts of interest to the end user
Metadata: data about data
Metadata provides description of data characteristics and relationships in data
Complements and expands value of data
Database management system (DBMS): collection of programs
Manage structure and control access to data

Role and Advantages of the DBMS
DBMS is the intermediary between the user and the database
Access database through the DBMS
DBMS enables data to be shared 
DBMS integrates many users’ views of the data

Advantages of a DBMS:
Improved data sharing
Improved data security
Better data integration
Minimized data inconsistency 
Improved data access
Improved decision making
Increased end-user productivity

Types of Databases
Databases can be classified according to:
Number of users
Database location(s)
Expected type and extent of use
Single-user database supports only one user at a time
Desktop database – single-user, runs on PC
Multiuser database supports multiple users at the same time
Workgroup database supports a small number
Enterprise database supports a large number

Data Redundancy
Data redundancy: same data stored unnecessarily in different places
Data inconsistency: different and conflicting versions of same data occur at different places

Database Systems
Database system consists of logically related data stored in a single logical data repository
May be physically distributed among multiple storage facilities
Current generation stores data structures, relationships between structures, access paths
Takes care of defining, storing, managing all access paths and components

DBMS Functions
Most functions transparent to end users
Can only be achieved through the DBMS
Data dictionary management
DBMS stores definitions of data elements and relationships (metadata) in a data dictionary
Data storage management
DBMS creates and manages complex structures required for data storage
Data transformation and presentation
Security management
Multiuser access control
Backup and recovery management
Data integrity management 
Database access languages and application programming interfaces
DBMS provides access through a query language
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the de facto query language 
Standard supported by majority of DBMS vendors
